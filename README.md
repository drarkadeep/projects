# purulent-personal-projects
these are those kinda projects. you know, the ones you make for yourself. and these are all in js. [js kidding these are standalone index.html files, but yeah, basically js]

## List of Projects
- [Word Frequency Analyser](https://drarkadeep.github.io/purulent-personal-projects/word-frequency-analyser/index.html) - List out all the unique words and find out how many times you have used them?
- [Word Counter](https://drarkadeep.github.io/purulent-personal-projects/word-counter/index.html) - It counts how many words you wrote. So, how many did you write?
- [Antarctic Time Tracker](https://drarkadeep.github.io/purulent-personal-projects/att/index.html) - Countsup from significant events. Has reset event and delete feature.
- [Uniquely Unix](https://drarkadeep.github.io/purulent-personal-projects/uniquely-unix/index.html) - I made this to resolve timezone issues I face while conducting sessions for [Neuromatch Academy](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/).
- [Portfolio Generator](https://drarkadeep.github.io/purulent-personal-projects/portfolio-generator/index.html) - Simple. I made a generator that helps me add new cards to my portfolio. I have no idea how this could be useful for anyone else.
- [TimeShift](https://drarkadeep.github.io/purulent-personal-projects/timeshift/index.html) - I made this to calibrate my postgraduate entrance revision slots. This worked in tandem with a buncha other local stuff I used to run. This can be helpful for you if you are dedicating an entire day for any goal. Feel free to alter the description and number of the shifts...

## Why do I make these?
These? There are a lot more of these. These are just the ones that I share. A more fundamental question would be - why did I make those, that is, those which are not these, when I'm not even sharing them with you. As for the question you asked, I make these for sharing with you.
