## List of Projects
1. [TimeShift](https://drarkadeep.github.io/purulent-personal-projects/timeshift/index.html) - I made this to calibrate my postgraduate entrance revision slots. This worked in tandem with a buncha other local stuff I used to run. This can be helpful for you if you are dedicating an entire day for any goal. Feel free to alter the description and number of the shifts...
