## List of Projects
- [Antarctic BP Tracker](https://arkadeep.com/projects/bp/index.html) - A cool app to reliably track your BP **worry-free** so that your BP remains even lower.
- [Suddenly Stoic](https://arkadeep.com/projects/suddenly-stoic/index.html) - Read stoic quotes collected by [awesome-stoicism](https://github.com/DavidWells/awesome-stoicism/tree/master) and save your favorites for sudden stoic needs.
- [The Rattlin' Bog](https://arkadeep.com/projects/the-rattlin-bog/index.html) - Oh-ro the rattli' lyrics generator for your Irish friends chillin' with a pint of Guiness!
- [100 second Zen](https://arkadeep.com/projects/100-second-zen/index.html) - Life is stressful. Breathe slowly for the next 100 seconds. You've earned it üòå
- [Page Tracker](https://arkadeep.com/projects/page-tracker/index.html) - A simple page tracker (fact: can also be used as task tracker) that shows your progress in each iteration while giving a **dynamic deadline estimate**. And as always, here is a [branded "pro" spin-off](https://arkadeep.com/projects/page-tracker/pro.html).
- [Word Frequency Analyser](https://arkadeep.com/projects/word-frequency-analyser/index.html) - List out all the unique words and find out how many times you have used them?
- [Word Counter](https://arkadeep.com/projects/word-counter/index.html) - It counts how many words you wrote. So, how many did you write?
- [Antarctic Time Tracker](https://arkadeep.com/projects/att/index.html) - Countsup from significant events. Has reset event and delete feature. I also added a bunch of extra features in [**ATTPro‚Ñ¢Ô∏è**](https://arkadeep.com/projects/att/pro.html)
- [Uniquely Unix](https://arkadeep.com/projects/uniquely-unix/index.html) - I made this to resolve timezone issues I face while conducting sessions for [Neuromatch Academy](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/).
- [Portfolio Generator](https://arkadeep.com/projects/portfolio-generator/index.html) - Simple. I made a generator that helps me add new cards to my portfolio. I have no idea how this could be useful for anyone else.
- [Bad Time](https://arkadeep.com/projects/bad-time/index.html) - A quick way to check the time in a few cities across the globe. This is a bad project. I am not proud of this.
- [TimeShift](https://arkadeep.com/projects/timeshift/index.html) - I made this to calibrate my postgraduate entrance revision slots. This worked in tandem with a buncha other local stuff I used to run. This can be helpful for you if you are dedicating an entire day for any goal. Feel free to alter the description and number of the shifts...
- [The Experiment](https://arkadeep.com/projects/the-experiment/index.html) - I don't know when I made this. A part of me tells me that it wasn't me who made it at all. It probably spawned into existence just like that! 

## Why do I make these?
These? There are a lot more of these. These are just the ones that I share. A more fundamental question would be - why did I make those, that is, those which are not these, when I'm not even sharing them with you. As for the question you asked, I make these for sharing with you.

## How do I make these?
I type the code (usually with fingers) onto a keyboard. The keyboard driver dutifully deposits the inputs onto some file which is effortlessly transported to my IDE-of-choice Visual Studio Code following which I sync my local folders with GitHub. LLMs often play silent but violent parts in this data pipeline.

## When do I make these?
Pretty much always. In fact, right now I'm probably working on something that'll be added to the repo soon. Keep checking it out...
