# purulent-personal-projects
these are those kinda projects. you know, the ones you make for yourself. and these are all in js. [js kidding these are standalone index.html files, but yeah, basically js]

## List of Projects
- [Uniquely Unix](https://drarkadeep.github.io/purulent-personal-projects/uniquely-unix/index.html) - I made this for navigating timezone issues I face while conducting sessions for [Neuromatch Academy](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7191285231650324480/). This is used along with the (unofficial) [tutorial lesson plan](https://nma.bearblog.dev/) I made for the [Neuromatch Computational Course](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html).
- [Portfolio Generator](https://drarkadeep.github.io/purulent-personal-projects/portfolio-generator/index.html) - Simple. I made a generator that helps me add new cards to my portfolio. I have no idea how this could be useful for anyone else.
- [TimeShift](https://drarkadeep.github.io/purulent-personal-projects/timeshift/index.html) - I made this to calibrate my postgraduate entrance revision slots. This worked in tandem with a buncha other local stuff I used to run. This can be helpful for you if you are dedicating an entire day for any goal. Feel free to alter the description and number of the shifts...
